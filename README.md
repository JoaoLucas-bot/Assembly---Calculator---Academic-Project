# Assembly-Project
MIPS Assembly Project : Scientific calculator

Each phase should be presented as a separate program with a header.

Phase 1 : When the program is run, it allows basic operations plus conversions
between decimal, binary and hexadecimal bases.

Phase 2 : The program includes advanced functions: logarithms in base 2 and base 10, power and
roots, sine and cosine.

Phase 3 : The program has a Help system where it shows the user help topics (eg.
“How do you calculate the logarithm?”) in a menu, accepts the user's choice and reads the answer from a file.

Phase 4 : The GUI has the look and feel of a scientific calculator, giving feedback
when the user touches a key.

Bonus Phase : The program has a graphical interface to show up to two functions and
display lines, parabolas and sinusoids according to user parameters (function, interval…).
